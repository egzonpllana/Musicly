## Structure ##

### Swifty Protocol-Oriented Dependency Injection ###

    * The key to dependency injection is protocols â€“ from there sprouts many variations,
    flavours, and techniques.
    * Battle-tested DI implementation with no outside dependencies or magic. 
    * It combines protocol extension and type erasure to give you a solid, flexible dependency
    injection that works great with unit test and even frameworks.
